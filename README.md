# Recipes, Ratings, & Regression
An analysis report by Jad Alaoui

## Introduction

Food.com is one of the largest repositories of community-contributed recipes and reviews on the internet. This analysis examines a comprehensive dataset extracted from the website, encompassing recipe submissions and user interactions from 2008 onwards. The dataset provides detailed information about recipes, including preparation methods, nutritional content, and user-generated reviews, making it a valuable resource for understanding cooking trends and user preferences in online culinary communities. By combining recipe attributes with user feedback, we can explore the relationships between recipe characteristics, such as preparation complexity and nutritional content, and user satisfaction as expressed through ratings and reviews.

What's more, food is one of the rare things in life that a majority of people feel comfortable giving their opinion on, mostly because it is a common, human experience. This led me to wondering what factors drive ratings on websites like food.com, a question I've tried to explore while getting familiar with this dataset.
